                    <p> The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) acquired its first artworks in 1929, the year it was established. Today, the Museum’s evolving collection contains almost 200,000 works from around the world spanning the last 150 years. The collection includes an ever-expanding range of visual expression, including painting, sculpture, printmaking, drawing, photography, architecture, design, film, and media and performance art. </p>
                    <p> MoMA is committed to helping everyone understand, enjoy, and use our collection. This website features almost 60,000 artworks from nearly 10,000 artists. If you are searching for a particular artist or artwork, it is best to search the collection and filter by date or classification. You can also explore the collection by viewing art that is now on display at the Museum, works that were recently added to the collection, or an index of artists.</p>
